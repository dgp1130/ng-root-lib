# Angular library with a demo application

This uses the Angular CLI to develop a library in the repository root with a
demo app under [`demo/`](/demo/). This is different from the typical monorepo
strategy of having everything as subdirectories under `projects/`.

## Build and run

```sh
ng build my-lib && ng serve my-app
```
